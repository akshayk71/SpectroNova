## Notes
**Hardcoded Values:** Most of the data used in this project is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.
**Progress Bars:** A few progress bars were not available in Vuetify. I plan to explore other libraries or implement a custom component to fulfill this requirement in the future.
**Component Structure:** Due to time constraints, the component structure can be improved. This project is a prototype, and refactoring for better scalability and
modularity will be explored further.
